# LLMCompiler: An LLM Compiler for Parallel Function Calling [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04511)]

![Thumbnail](figs/thumbnail.png)

**LLMCompiler** is a framework that enables an _efficient and effective orchestration of parallel function calling_ with LLMs, including both open-source and close-source models, by automatically identifying which tasks can be performed in parallel and which ones are interdependent.


**TL;DR:**
The reasoning capabilities of LLMs enable them to execute multiple function calls, using user-provided functions to overcome
their inherent limitations (e.g. knowledge cutoffs, poor arithmetic skills, or lack of access to private data).
While multi-function calling allows them to tackle more complex problems, 
current methods often require sequential reasoning and acting for each function which can result
in high latency, cost, and sometimes inaccurate behavior.
LLMCompiler addresses this by decomposing problems into multiple tasks 
that can be executed in parallel, thereby efficiently orchestrating multi-function calling.
With LLMCompiler, the user specifies the tools
along with optional in-context examples, and **LLMCompiler automatically computes an optimized orchestration for
the function calls**.
LLMCompiler can be used with open-source models such as LLaMA, as well as OpenAIâ€™s GPT models.
Across a range of tasks that exhibit different patterns of parallel function calling, LLMCompiler 
consistently demonstrated **latency speedup, cost saving, and accuracy improvement**.

## News
* ðŸ“Œ [1/17] Running custom models using vLLM supported
* ðŸ¦™ [12/29] LLMCompiler is available on [LlamaIndex](https://llamahub.ai/l/llama_packs-agents-llm_compiler?from=llama_packs)

## Installation

1. Create a conda environment and install the dependencies
```
conda create --name llmcompiler python=3.10 -y
conda activate llmcompiler
```

2. Clone and install the dependencies
```
git clone https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/LLMCompiler
cd LLMCompiler
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---
## Basic Runs
To reproduce the evaluation results in the paper, run the following command.
```
python run_llm_compiler.py --api_key {openai-api-key} --benchmark {benchmark-name} --store {store-path} [--logging] [--stream]
```

To run a custom models served using the vLLM framework, run the following command.
Detailed instructions for serving custom models with the vLLM framework can be found in the [vLLM documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/quickstart.html#openai-compatible-server).
Note that the pre-defined prompts in the default configuration files are tailored for (non-chat) LLaMA-2 70B and might need adjustments for different models.
```
python run_llm_compiler.py --model_type vllm --benchmark {benchmark-name} --store {store-path} --model_name {vllm-model-name} --vllm_port {vllm-port} [--logging]
```

* `--api_key`: OpenAI API Key
* `--benchmark`: Benchmark name. Use `hotpotqa`, `movie`, and `parallelqa` to evaluate LLMCompiler on the HotpotQA, Movie Recommendation, and ParallelQA benchmarks, respectively.
* `--store`: Path to save the result. Question, true label, prediction, and latency per example will be stored in a JSON format.
* `--logging`: (Optional) Enables logging. Not yet supported for vLLM.
* `--stream`: (Optional, Recommended) Enables streaming. It improves latency by streaming out tasks from the Planner to the Task Fetching Unit and Executor immediately after their generation, rather than blocking the Executor until all the tasks are generated from the Planner.
* `--react`: (Optional) Use ReAct instead of LLMCompiler for baseline evaluation.

After the run is over, you can get the summary of the results by running the following command:
```
python evaluate_results.py --file {store-path}
```

## Adding Your Custom Benchmark
To use LLMCompiler on your custom benchmarks or use cases, 
you only need to provide the functions and their descriptions, as well as example prompts.
Please refer to `configs/hotpotqa`, `configs/movie`, and `configs/parallelqa` as examples. 

* `gpt_prompts.py`: Defines in-context example prompts
* `tools.py`: Defines functions (i.e. tools) to use, and their descriptions (i.e. instructions and arguments)

## Roadmap
We are planning to update the following features soon:
* Support for open-source models (e.g. LLaMA-2)
* Tree-of-Thoughts evaluation we used in the paper
